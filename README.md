# OpenLinux
A small, compact Linux virtual machine. WIP.

## Some things to note before installation
 - You cannot install Python using this, you will have to have Python pre-installed.
 - An error might occur if you have an unsupported system.
 - If you have not configured OpenLinux before running, your virtualised linux terminal will be useless.
 - YOU NEED to have general bash commands installed before running.
 - OpenLinux terminal will need to have access to Administrator privilages if you are installing something on your local machine, not the virtual machine.
 
> :warning: Please try to do these with care. Doing without may cause `damage to your device.`

OpenLinux will need a total size of 1 GB or more. You can edit the size accordingly in configuration.

The whole point of OpenLinux is to make running Linux apps easier and awesomer. If we do not meet your requirements, please leave a [issue in the Issues tab](https://github.com/JustAnEric/OpenLinux/issues).
