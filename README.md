# OpenLinux
A small, compact Linux virtual machine. WIP.

## Some things to note before installation
 - You cannot install Python using this, you will have to have Python pre-installed.
 - An error might occur if you have an unsupported system.
 - If you have not configured OpenLinux before running, your virtualised linux terminal will be useless.
